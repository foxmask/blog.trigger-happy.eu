# Alternativeto.net

You can now find alternatives of [Trigger Happy](https://alternativeto.net/software/trigger-happy/) on [alternative to](https://alternativeto.net/) and see with which others projects it can be compared.
There is lot of interesting project ;-)


# New services

New services are supported with Trigger Happy : [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [Trello](https://trello.com) "Organize anything, together."

A scenario we can now make is to create an issue on a github project, once a card is created in a board of Trello


# Contact and future

If you already know the project LibreBoard, an opensource clone of Trello, which is became Wekan, [it is planed to make a REST API](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/166) to be able to be used like Trello. So TriggerHappy will be ready as soon as they will finished this API.
