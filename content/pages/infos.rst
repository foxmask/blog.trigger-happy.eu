What is this ?
--------------
As it exists tools to make his blog or website or even his own cloud system, "Trigger Happy" is a `free software`_ that provides a micro `Enterprise service bus (ESB)`_


How does it work ?
------------------

Trigger Happy enters in a new category of tools which permits to manage the connection between internet services, as a bridge between them, and will act from events triggered:

* on the web
* on your own "internet" accounts

Examples :

* When a news is published on a website, I want it to be stored in my Evernote or Pocket account to be read later, or published it on Twitter, or on my Facebook wall, etc...
* when I add a note to my Evernote account, I want to send it to my Pocket account also
* When a tweet about a specific subject is published, send it to my Pocket/Evernote/Whatever account
* etcâ€¦

All of this is widely inspired by the very great IFTTT service which permits that exchanges.

If you have `Python`_/`Django`_ skills, I invite you to read `the documentation`_ which details all of this

How is this service born ?
--------------------------

Following setbacks with a service called IFTTT which made unreadable notes (because it did not handle accented characters UTF-8), the decision was made to launch a free alternative.
