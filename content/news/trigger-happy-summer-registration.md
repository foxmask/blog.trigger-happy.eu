summary: This summer was suitable to many registrations of users on TriggerHappy website.
status: Published

Since the beginning of this summer, when the release 1.0 was published, many of you decided to try and see how the project behaved.

One of the last services that was integrated and has your favor is Pushbullet.

Unfortunatly for everyone, the access to the service is limited very quickly because the access to pushbullet is done from a "free account" which is limit to 500 access... by month, and so the Rate Limit is reached in a day or two ;)

So to avoid to have the "free account" of TriggerHappy.eu banned for ever, the access of Pushbullet from TriggerHappy.eu is suspended.

If you appreciate the project, I suggest you install it on your own server, and then you will have a fully access to Pubshbullet with your own "free account".

If you need support for that, feel free to [contact me](https://trigger-happy.eu/contactus/)

Also when you use the website and encounter some errors (like the error 500), feel free to contact me too ;)

Usually, the errors are quickly reported to me and fixed, so another try 1 or 2 days later should be fine.
