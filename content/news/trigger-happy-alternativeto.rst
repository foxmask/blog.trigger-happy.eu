Alternativeto.net
-----------------
You can now find alternatives of `Trigger Happy`_ on `alternative to`_ and see with which others projects it can be compared.
There is lot of interesting project ;-)


New services
------------
New services are supported with Trigger Happy : `GitHub`_ and `Trello`_ "Organize anything, together."

A scenario we can now make is to create an issue on a github project, once a card is created in a board of Trello


Contact and future
------------------
If you already know the project LibreBoard, an opensource clone of Trello, which is became Wekan, `it is planed to make a REST API`_ to be able to be used like Trello. So TriggerHappy will be ready as soon as they will finished this API.
